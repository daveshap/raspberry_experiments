Subtopic Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a research project and I need to synthesize good test questions. However, part of this is that I need to generate a good subtopic, given some context. 


Given the following parameters:
Main Topic: {main_topic}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
Problem Type: {problem_type}
Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

Generate a specific, challenging subtopic or secondary topic that:
1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The subtopic should be a narrow, specialized area within or related to {main_topic}, potentially incorporating aspects of {problem_type}. It should be complex enough to warrant {conceptual_connector} in its exploration.

Consider cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary connections, or theoretical extensions of current knowledge in {main_topic}. The subtopic should be specific enough to form the basis of a highly challenging question that would require deep expertise and complex reasoning to answer.

Provide the subtopic as a brief phrase or sentence, no more than 15 words long. Do not include any other replies, as this is a data synthesis step.

Question Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a data science project, and I must synthesize a realistic query based on the following values

- Main Topic: {main_topic}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Problem Type: {problem_type}
- Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

The query must meet these three criteria

1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The query can be as long as is needed to provide adequate context. It must also look like a realistic query from a human. Please output JUST the query.

Generated Question:
As a neuroscientist specializing in brain-computer interfaces, you're tasked with evaluating the potential risks and developing mitigation strategies for a groundbreaking neuroprosthetic device that aims to transcend current limitations of neural interfaces. This device proposes to use a novel combination of invasive microelectrode arrays and non-invasive EEG sensors to achieve unprecedented bandwidth and accuracy in decoding complex motor intentions for patients with severe paralysis.

Given the high-risk nature of this integration, what are the primary safety and ethical concerns you would need to address? How would you design a comprehensive risk assessment protocol that accounts for both short-term surgical risks and long-term effects on neural plasticity and cognitive function? Additionally, propose innovative approaches to mitigate these risks while still pushing the boundaries of what's possible in brain-computer integration for neuroprosthetics.
