Subtopic: Bridging the gap between nanotechnology and targeted drug delivery in neurodegenerative disease treatment.

Subtopic Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a research project and I need to synthesize good test questions. However, part of this is that I need to generate a good subtopic, given some context. 


Given the following parameters:
Main Topic: {main_topic}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
Problem Type: {problem_type}
Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

Generate a specific, challenging subtopic or secondary topic that:
1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The subtopic should be a narrow, specialized area within or related to {main_topic}, potentially incorporating aspects of {problem_type}. It should be complex enough to warrant {conceptual_connector} in its exploration.

Consider cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary connections, or theoretical extensions of current knowledge in {main_topic}. The subtopic should be specific enough to form the basis of a highly challenging question that would require deep expertise and complex reasoning to answer.

Provide the subtopic as a brief phrase or sentence, no more than 15 words long. Do not include any other replies, as this is a data synthesis step.

Question Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a data science project, and I must synthesize a realistic query based on the following values

- Main Topic: {main_topic}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Problem Type: {problem_type}
- Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

The query must meet these three criteria

1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The query can be as long as is needed to provide adequate context. It must also look like a realistic query from a human. Please output JUST the query.

Generated Question:
As a leading researcher in nanomedicine, you've been tasked with designing a novel drug delivery system for treating Alzheimer's disease. Your challenge is to bridge the gap between current nanotechnology capabilities and the specific requirements for targeted drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier. 

Considering the complex nature of Alzheimer's pathology, propose a multifunctional nanoparticle design that can:

1. Efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier
2. Selectively target and bind to amyloid-beta plaques
3. Deliver a combination of therapeutic agents (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs and neuroprotective compounds)
4. Provide real-time imaging capabilities for monitoring treatment progress

In your proposal, address the following aspects:

a) The composition and structure of the nanoparticle
b) The mechanism for crossing the blood-brain barrier
c) The targeting strategy for amyloid-beta plaques
d) The drug release mechanism and kinetics
e) The imaging modality and how it will be incorporated into the nanoparticle design
f) Potential challenges in scaling up production and clinical translation

Additionally, discuss how this design could be adapted for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease.
