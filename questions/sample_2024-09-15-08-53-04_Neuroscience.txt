As a neuroscientist specializing in brain-computer interfaces, you're tasked with evaluating the potential risks and developing mitigation strategies for a groundbreaking neuroprosthetic device that aims to transcend current limitations of neural interfaces. This device proposes to use a novel combination of invasive microelectrode arrays and non-invasive EEG sensors to achieve unprecedented bandwidth and accuracy in decoding complex motor intentions for patients with severe paralysis.

Given the high-risk nature of this integration, what are the primary safety and ethical concerns you would need to address? How would you design a comprehensive risk assessment protocol that accounts for both short-term surgical risks and long-term effects on neural plasticity and cognitive function? Additionally, propose innovative approaches to mitigate these risks while still pushing the boundaries of what's possible in brain-computer integration for neuroprosthetics.
