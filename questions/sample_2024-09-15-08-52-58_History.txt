What would have been the potential ramifications for European power dynamics if the Principality of Liechtenstein had successfully negotiated a marriage alliance with the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1784, and how might this hypothetical union have influenced the diplomatic strategies of neighboring microstates like San Marino and Monaco during the lead-up to the French Revolution? Drawing parallels between this counterfactual scenario and the actual diplomatic maneuvers of these small states, analyze how such an alliance could have altered their survival strategies and relationships with larger powers in the tumultuous final decades of the 18th century.
