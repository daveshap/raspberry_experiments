Subtopic Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a research project and I need to synthesize good test questions. However, part of this is that I need to generate a good subtopic, given some context. 


Given the following parameters:
Main Topic: {main_topic}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
Problem Type: {problem_type}
Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

Generate a specific, challenging subtopic or secondary topic that:
1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The subtopic should be a narrow, specialized area within or related to {main_topic}, potentially incorporating aspects of {problem_type}. It should be complex enough to warrant {conceptual_connector} in its exploration.

Consider cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary connections, or theoretical extensions of current knowledge in {main_topic}. The subtopic should be specific enough to form the basis of a highly challenging question that would require deep expertise and complex reasoning to answer.

Provide the subtopic as a brief phrase or sentence, no more than 15 words long. Do not include any other replies, as this is a data synthesis step.

Question Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a data science project, and I must synthesize a realistic query based on the following values

- Main Topic: {main_topic}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Problem Type: {problem_type}
- Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

The query must meet these three criteria

1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The query can be as long as is needed to provide adequate context. It must also look like a realistic query from a human. Please output JUST the query.

Generated Question:
How can we reconcile the differences in macro-level social structures and micro-level individual agency to optimize societal functioning? Consider the potential tensions between institutional norms and personal autonomy, the role of social capital in bridging these levels, and the impact of technological advancements on this dynamic. Propose a theoretical framework that integrates both top-down and bottom-up approaches to social change, addressing potential feedback loops and emergent properties in the system. How might this framework be applied to address contemporary social issues such as income inequality, political polarization, and environmental sustainability?
