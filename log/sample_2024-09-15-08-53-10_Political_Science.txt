Conceptual Connector: Reframing in terms of
Subtopic: Reframing global power dynamics through fractal patterns in geopolitical decision-making processes

Subtopic Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a research project and I need to synthesize good test questions. However, part of this is that I need to generate a good subtopic, given some context. 


Given the following parameters:
Main Topic: {main_topic}
Difficulty Level: {difficulty}
Problem Type: {problem_type}
Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

Generate a specific, challenging subtopic or secondary topic that:
1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The subtopic should be a narrow, specialized area within or related to {main_topic}, potentially incorporating aspects of {problem_type}. It should be complex enough to warrant {conceptual_connector} in its exploration.

Consider cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary connections, or theoretical extensions of current knowledge in {main_topic}. The subtopic should be specific enough to form the basis of a highly challenging question that would require deep expertise and complex reasoning to answer.

Provide the subtopic as a brief phrase or sentence, no more than 15 words long. Do not include any other replies, as this is a data synthesis step.

Question Prompt Template:
Hi, I am working on a data science project, and I must synthesize a realistic query based on the following values

- Main Topic: {main_topic}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Problem Type: {problem_type}
- Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

The query must meet these three criteria

1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The query can be as long as is needed to provide adequate context. It must also look like a realistic query from a human. Please output JUST the query.

Generated Question:
How might we apply the concept of fractal patterns to reframe our understanding of global power dynamics in political science? Consider how self-similar structures at different scales could manifest in geopolitical decision-making processes, from local governance to international relations. What implications would this perspective have on traditional theories of power distribution and the behavior of political actors? Additionally, how could this reframing help us identify and analyze previously overlooked patterns in diplomatic strategies and policy formation across various levels of government?
