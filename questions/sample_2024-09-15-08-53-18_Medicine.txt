As a leading researcher in nanomedicine, you've been tasked with designing a novel drug delivery system for treating Alzheimer's disease. Your challenge is to bridge the gap between current nanotechnology capabilities and the specific requirements for targeted drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier. 

Considering the complex nature of Alzheimer's pathology, propose a multifunctional nanoparticle design that can:

1. Efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier
2. Selectively target and bind to amyloid-beta plaques
3. Deliver a combination of therapeutic agents (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs and neuroprotective compounds)
4. Provide real-time imaging capabilities for monitoring treatment progress

In your proposal, address the following aspects:

a) The composition and structure of the nanoparticle
b) The mechanism for crossing the blood-brain barrier
c) The targeting strategy for amyloid-beta plaques
d) The drug release mechanism and kinetics
e) The imaging modality and how it will be incorporated into the nanoparticle design
f) Potential challenges in scaling up production and clinical translation

Additionally, discuss how this design could be adapted for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease.
