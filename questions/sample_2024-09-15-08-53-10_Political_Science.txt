How might we apply the concept of fractal patterns to reframe our understanding of global power dynamics in political science? Consider how self-similar structures at different scales could manifest in geopolitical decision-making processes, from local governance to international relations. What implications would this perspective have on traditional theories of power distribution and the behavior of political actors? Additionally, how could this reframing help us identify and analyze previously overlooked patterns in diplomatic strategies and policy formation across various levels of government?
