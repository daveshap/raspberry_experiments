Hi, I am working on a data science project, and I must synthesize a realistic query based on the following values

- Main Topic: {main_topic}
- Subtopic: {subtopic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Problem Type: {problem_type}
- Conceptual Connector: {conceptual_connector}

The query must meet these three criteria

1. Is answerable without external resources
2. Requires multiple reasoning steps
3. Is suitable for {difficulty} level expertise

The query can be as long as is needed to provide adequate context. It must also look like a realistic query from a human. Please output JUST the query.
