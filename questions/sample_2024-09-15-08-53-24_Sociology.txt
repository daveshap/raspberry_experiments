How can we reconcile the differences in macro-level social structures and micro-level individual agency to optimize societal functioning? Consider the potential tensions between institutional norms and personal autonomy, the role of social capital in bridging these levels, and the impact of technological advancements on this dynamic. Propose a theoretical framework that integrates both top-down and bottom-up approaches to social change, addressing potential feedback loops and emergent properties in the system. How might this framework be applied to address contemporary social issues such as income inequality, political polarization, and environmental sustainability?
